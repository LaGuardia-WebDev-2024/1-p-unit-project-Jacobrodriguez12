<p style="color: rgb(141, 141, 10);">Penne alla vodka is a popular Italian-American pasta dish featuring penne pasta and a <strong>rich, creamy, and flavorful</strong> tomato sauce infused with vodka. The vodka is a critical ingredient that gives the sauce its signature silky texture and enhances the other flavors without adding a strong alcoholic taste. . The sauce also includes aromatics like onions and garlic, often with seasonings such as red pepper flakes, and is frequently garnished with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil. The vodka cooks off during simmering, leaving behind a subtle depth and balancing the sauce's tanginess and richness. </p>
